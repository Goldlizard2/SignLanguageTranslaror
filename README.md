### COSC428 Computer Vision Assignment Okoko Anainga
### Signlanguage Detection

# Objective
The purpose of this project was to get exposure to computer vision. I chose to complete a sign language translator by using Deep learning to identify 5 signs from the American Sign Language Dictionary.

These signs were "I Love You", "Yes", "No", "Hello" and "Thank you"

For training the Neural Network for deep learning I created my own images that were captured through a web cam then I labeled them with the python image label tool.

I trained the NN with 40000 runs and 4 epochs and got down to a loss of 0.079. This seems quite effective for sign identification.
